# Tumor Growth Modeling using Logistic Equation

This project models tumor growth using the logistic growth equation.
The aim is to understand how tumor cell population evolves over time 
under resource limitations (carrying capacity).

Tools used:
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

This project was developed as part of my interest in computational 
systems biology and mathematical oncology.
